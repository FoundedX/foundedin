This a a very basic template for a webapp similar to http://foundedinholland.com

Some credit goes to:

http://foundedinholland.com, for the cool idea and wicked frontend code
https://github.com/codrops/MinimalForm, for the super cool sliding single input form

This project is almost ready to be pasted into a google app engine project and deployed, the app.yaml should be adapted to take your project id into account, a mandrill key should be inserted in the utils.py file, so that early adopters can receive their mail, and then the necessary scripts for google analytics, twitter and facebook should be included in the index.html file.

We've kept the scripts in the various html files, but these should be put in their own folder and minified in production.

Artwork specific to foundedinsouthafrica should be replaced, our artwork was greatly influenced by foundedinholland.com and was put together by Johann (https://www.behance.net/JohannduBruyn)
